## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse

### Package dplyr
- Function `select()` from package [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#select-columns-with-select)). It using for select columns

```
starwars %>% select(name,height)
```
** You can sepearate this part or combine in part of `Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data`

## Part 3: Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data

//Explain here

```
#Code here
```

Result:

```
#Copy Result from console to here
```
//Explain

- list 1
- list 2

## Part 4: Visualization with GGplot2
### 1.) Graph show relation between height and mass
```
scat_plot <- starwars %>% filter(mass<500) %>% ggplot(aes(x=height,y=mass))+
  geom_point(aes(color=gender))

scat_plot+geom_smooth()
```
Result:
